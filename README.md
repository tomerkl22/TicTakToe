# TicTakToe

Tomer Klein

To play tic-tac-toe, each player takes turns placing their symbol (either an X or an O) on an empty space on the grid. 
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. 
If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
